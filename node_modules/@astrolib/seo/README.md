# Astro SEO - @astrolib/seo

`Astro SEO` is an integration that makes managing your SEO easier in Astro projects. It is fully based on the excellent [Next SEO](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) library

## Usage

`Astro SEO` works by including it on pages where you would like SEO attributes to be added. Once included on the page you pass it a configuration object with the page's SEO properties. This can be dynamically generated at a page level or in some cases your API may return an SEO object.

### Setup

First, install it:

```bash
npm install @astrolib/seo
```

or

```bash
yarn add @astrolib/seo
```

### Add SEO to Page

Then you need to import `@astrolib/seo` and add the desired properties. This will render out the tags in the `<head>` for SEO. At a bare minimum, you should add a title and description.

**Example with just title and description:**

```astro
---
import { AstroSeo } from '@astrolib/seo';
---

<AstroSeo
  title="Simple Usage Example"
  description="A short description goes here."
/>
```

But `Astro SEO` gives you many more options that you can add. See below for a typical example of a page.

**Typical page example:**

```astro
---
import { AstroSeo } from '@astrolib/seo';
---

<AstroSeo
  title="Using More of Config"
  description="This example uses more of the available config options."
